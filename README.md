## Yomu
Manga Reader App for OSX

## Install
Since [yomu api server](https://github.com/sendyhalim/yomu-server) is still in development,
you need to clone it.

1. Clone yomu osx `git clone https://github.com/sendyhalim/yomu`
2. Clone yomu server `git clone https://github.com/sendyhalim/yomu-server`
3. Install mongodb
4. Install dependencies `npm install`
5. Start the server `npm start`
6. Open yomu app with xcode and build it :tada:

## What's next?
- Save added manga, preferably using [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa)
- Create a makefile target to create yomu app package
- Implement zoom functionality
